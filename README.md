# Simple Expression Calculator

<p>
This is a basic project using ANTLR4 to calculate the value of a single-line expression such as:
</p>
<p>
 * let(a, let(b, 10, add(b,b)), let(b, 20, add(a, b)) 
</p>
<p>
which evaluates to 40
</p>

The expression syntax supports basic arithmetic, as well as a "let" operation where an expression or number can 
be assigned to a variable.
 
The arithmetic operations supported are:
* div(val1, val2): divides val1 by val2
* mult(val1, val2): multiplies val1 and val2
* add(val1, val2): adds val1 and val2
* sub(val1, val2): subtracts val2 from val1

where val1 and val2 can be an integer or an expression that evaluates to a number.
 
The expected input integer range is Integer.MIN_VALUE to Integer.MAX_VALUE.
 
Digits of precision and rounding behavior can be specified when constructing 
the Calculator class by using a desired MathContext instance.
 
Arithmetic examples (using DECIMAL128): 
  * div(9, 3) -&gt; 3
  * add(20, div(9, 3)) -&gt; 23
  * sub(-10, -12) -&gt; 2
  * add(2147483647, 1) -&gt; 2147483648
  * div(5, 9) -&gt; 0.5555555555555555555555555555555556
  * div(1, 0) -&gt; "Problem parsing/calculating expression: 'div(1, 0)' (java.lang.ArithmeticException: Division by zero)"
    
The syntax of the "let" operation is: _let(varName, val_expr, expr)_
  * varName: the name of the variable one more of characters: a-z|A-Z
  * val_expr: a number or expression
  * expr: an expression using the defined variable

The current scope is to support only these operations above, 
though it would be simple to add a modulo operation for example.

Examples incorporating the "let" operation:
 * let(a, 5, add(a, 9)) -&gt; 14
 * let(a, let(b, 10, add(b,b)), let(b, 20, add(a, b)) -&gt; 40

Plugins included in the pom.xml for this project, with some basic configuration (i.e. to exclude generated ANTLR files):
* PMD https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-pmd-plugin/
* checkstyle https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-checkstyle-plugin/
* findbugs http://gleclaire.github.io/findbugs-maven-plugin/
* Javadoc https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-javadoc-plugin/
** _mvn site_ will generate reports to target/site/ for the plugins above
* JaCoCo - painful to configure, but finally found a good example at: http://www.petrikainulainen.net/programming/maven/creating-code-coverage-reports-for-unit-and-integration-tests-with-the-jacoco-maven-plugin/
** _mvn clean test_ runs unit tests and creates the code coverage report to the directory target/site/jacoco-ut.

Known limitations:
 * only integer values are accepted in the expression string
 ** decimal values could be easily supported by updating the NUMBER definition in the BasicCalculator.g4 grammar file (with corresponding updates to unit tests)
 * variable names are alphabetic only 
 ** alpha-numeric variable names could be easily supported by updating the VARIABLE definition in the BasicCalculator.g4 grammar file (with corresponding updates to unit tests)
 * The code to do calculations and determine the final value of the supplied expression string is recursive.
 ** With default JVM settings, a StackOverflowError will occur at ~11 levels of nested expressions.
 ** See the unit test assign12LevelsDeepCausesStackOverflow() in CalculatorAssignmentTest.
 ** If necessary, a StackOverflowError can be alleviated by increasing the stack size:
 *** The JVM stack size can be increased using the -Xss flag. (-Xss<size>[g|G|m|M|k|K])
 *** This flag can be specified either via the projectâ€™s configuration, or via the command line.
 ** StackOverflowErrors could also be prevented if necessary by refactoring the code to not use recursion.
 

Testing / debugging changes to the BasicCalculator.g4 grammar file:
* Per "The Definitive ANTLR 4 Reference" by Terrence Parr:
"ANTLR provides a flexible testing tool in the runtime library called TestRig. 
It can display lots of information about how a recognizer matches input from a 
file or standard input. TestRig uses Java reflection to invoke compiled recognizers."

This project was made possible by the ANTLR framework from Terence Parr (http://www.antlr.org/) and the example at
http://niels.nu/blog/2015/antlr-is-awesome.html by Niels Dommerholt.

Note: there may well be room for improvement in this code (suggestions are welcome), since the functionality 
is based on a day of effort to find, understand the basics of, and apply ANTLR4.
All of the surrounding project configuration, unit tests and cleanup, etc. has taken some additional effort.
